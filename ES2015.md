## Let

```javascript
let variable = "value";
```
*defines a variable*

* `let` defines variable scoped to the nearest block (`function`, `if`, etc.)
* `let` defined variables are not hoisted the the beginning of the function (unlike `var`)
* `let` defined variables will still raise a `ReferenceError` if called outside of their scope
* `let` solves the problem of using callbacks in for loops :

```javascript
for (let index in array) {
  fetchElement(array[index], function() {
    console.log(`${array[index]} fetched`);
  })
}
```
*Won't work with `var` as `index` will always be the last key, but works fine with let.*


* `let` defined variables can be reassigned but redeclaring them within the same scope will raise a `TypeError` :

```javascript
let favoriteMusician = "Miles Davis";
favoriteMusician = "Frank Zappa"; // Yup
let favoriteMusician = "Justin Bieber"; // TypeError
```


## Const

```javascript
const MAX_SIZE = 64;
```
*defines a constant*

In most cases, `const`-vars will behave like `let`-vars, but unlike `let` defined variables :
* Constants cannot be reassigned without raising an error or failing silently
* Constants cannot be defined without having a value assigned

Constants should be used when it's sure that it's value won't change during the program lifespan.

```javascript
const MAX_SIZE = 64; // Okay
const MAX_SIZE; // Nope
MAX_SIZE = 64; // Nope
```
